# Add Recurring Expenses

Enhance the expense tracker with recurring expense support.

## Requirements

- Expenses can be marked as recurring (weekly, monthly)
- System automatically creates new expense entries based on schedule
- Dashboard shows upcoming recurring expenses
- Can edit/delete recurring patterns

## Notes

This builds on the existing implementation. Update SPEC.md first with the new feature design.
